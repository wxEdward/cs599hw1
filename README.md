# cs599hw
This is the repository for HW codes.

Both notebook version and scripts are provided. Notebook version is more clear.

The dataset web-berkstan is too large to be uploaded to github. If the dataset is needed for some problem, please put the corresponding dataset file and scripts/notebooks in the same folder, so that the script/notebook can run successfully.
